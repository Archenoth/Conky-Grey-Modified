#+TITLE:Conky Grey Modified

This Git repo is my modification of the amazing [[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=137272][Conky Grey theme]]... (Not made by me.)

[[file:./Screenshot.png]]

Some notable changes are:
- Two-pane IP address monitor to display twice the IPs
- Network interfaces disappear when you disable them
- Network activity history is actively monitored and shown in a graph
- Four CPU cores instead of two

* Installation
To install this, you first need to have [[http://conky.sourceforge.net/][Conky]]. (No, really..!)

Most Linux distributions should have this in their package managers, so simply typing =apt-get install conky-all= or =yum install conky= with root privileges should be all you need.

Then, from this folder, you simply invoke:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  conky -c conkyrc_grey
#+END_SRC

Conky will then start up and fork into the background, so you can close the terminal you ran it from or continue working on whatever.

To stop it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pkill conky
#+END_SRC

* Customizing
Since you likely have a different disk setup than I, you may wish to change or remove the =/host= filesystem from Conky.

You can remove it by running the following in this folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sed -i '76d' conkyrc_grey && sed -i '201,221d' conky_grey.lua
#+END_SRC

Or, if you wish to simply update it with something else, you can do so with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sed -i -e 's#/host#/path/to/replace/with#g' conky*
#+END_SRC

As of the time of writing, there is also currently only patch included with this repo (There were more before the new configuration, so those may show up here again later):

** two-cpu.patch
This patch is to switch Conky back to displaying only two CPU cores. This is for people that do not have four cores to display on the monitor.

This patch can be applied like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch < patches/two-cpu.patch
#+END_SRC

And to switch it back:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch -R < patches/two-cpu.patch
#+END_SRC
