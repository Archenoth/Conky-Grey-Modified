#+TITLE:Conky Grey Modified

This Git repo is my modification of the amazing [[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=137272][Conky Grey
theme]]... (Not made by me.)

Notable changes are:
- Two-pane IP address monitor to display twice the IPs
- Network interfaces disappear when you disable them
- Network activity history is actively monitored and shown in a graph
- Four CPU cores instead of just one
