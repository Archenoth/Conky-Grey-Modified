#+TITLE:Conky Grey Modified

This Git repo is my modification of the amazing [[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=137272][Conky Grey
theme]]... (Not made by me.)

[[file:./Screenshot.png]]

Notable changes are:
- Two-pane IP address monitor to display twice the IPs
- Network interfaces disappear when you disable them
- Network activity history is actively monitored and shown in a graph
- Four CPU cores instead of just one

* Installation
To install this, you first need to have [[http://conky.sourceforge.net/][Conky]]. (No, really..!)

Most Linux distributions should have this in their package managers,
so simply typing =apt-get isntall conky= or =yum instal conky= with
root privileges should be all you need.

Then, from this folder, you simply invoke:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  conky -c conkyrc_grey
#+END_SRC

Conky will then start up and fork into the background, so you can
close the terminal you ran it from or continue working on whatever.

To stop it:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  pkill conky
#+END_SRC

* Customizing
Since you likely have a different disk setup than I, you may wish to
change or remove the =/host= filesystem from Conky.

You can remove it by running the following in this folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  awk 'NR!~/^74$/' conkyrc_grey
#+END_SRC

Or, if you wish to simply update it with something else, you can do
so with:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  find -exec sed -i -e 's#/host#/path/to/replace/with#g' {} \;
#+END_SRC

(Except you would replace "=/path/to/replace/with=" with your desired
path.)
