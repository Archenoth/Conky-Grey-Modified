#+TITLE:Conky Grey Modified

This Git repo is my modification of the amazing [[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=137272][Conky Grey
theme]]... (Not made by me.)

[[file:./Screenshot.png]]

Notable (default) changes are:
- Two-pane IP address monitor to display twice the IPs
- Network interfaces disappear when you disable them
- Network activity history is actively monitored and shown in a graph
- Four CPU cores instead of two

I say "default" because I have included a few patches and instructions
that will let you customize most of the above.

* Installation
To install this, you first need to have [[http://conky.sourceforge.net/][Conky]]. (No, really..!)

Most Linux distributions should have this in their package managers,
so simply typing =apt-get install conky-all= or =yum install conky=
with root privileges should be all you need.

Then, from this folder, you simply invoke:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  conky -c conkyrc_grey
#+END_SRC

Conky will then start up and fork into the background, so you can
close the terminal you ran it from or continue working on whatever.

To stop it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pkill conky
#+END_SRC

* Customizing
Since you likely have a different disk setup than I, you may wish to
change or remove the =/host= filesystem from Conky.

You can remove it by running the following in this folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sed -i '74d' conkyrc_grey && sed -i '201,221d' conky_grey.lua
#+END_SRC

Or, if you wish to simply update it with something else, you can do
so with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sed -i -e 's#/host#/path/to/replace/with#g' conky*
#+END_SRC

(Except you would replace "=/path/to/replace/with=" with your desired
path.)

A couple of patches are also included with Conky Grey Modified that
will allow you to change the theme to do some pretty neat
things. (Yes, these could have been Git commits, though this works
without Git if you just downloaded an archive of this repo.)

As of the time of writing, there are three patches included:

** lots-o-lines.patch
Lots 'o lines is a patch that adds a massive amount of lines to the
network monitor. The idea behind this patch is that it allows you to
make use of the extra screen real-estate on your desktop to keep
track of network connections.

To use it, in the current folder, you can simply run the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch < patches/lots-o-lines.patch
#+END_SRC

And to change it back:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch -R < patches/lots-o-lines.patch
#+END_SRC

** white-background.patch
White Background is a patch that updates the theme to be usable on a
bright (or white!) background.

It does this by making the colors for the text and monitors far
darker.

Like the previous patch, to apply this one, you can run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch < patches/white-background.patch
#+END_SRC

And, if you don't want it any more:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch -R < patches/white-background.patch
#+END_SRC

** two-cpu.patch
This patch is to switch Conky back to displaying only two CPU
cores. This is for people that do not have four cores to display on
the monitor.

And once again, this patch can be applied like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch < patches/two-cpu.patch
#+END_SRC

And to switch it back:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch -R < patches/two-cpu.patch
#+END_SRC
